# Freelancer Website Template

A simple PHP-based modular website template, designed for freelancers. This template utilizes PHP for component-based page rendering and organizes assets and partials for efficient inclusion across the site.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to promote reusability and ease of maintenance. Each main section (header, portfolio, about, contact, footer) is split into partials and imported into the main HTML structure using PHP `require` statements.

### Folder Structure

- **partials**: Contains all reusable partial files.
  - **head**: Contains meta tags, CSS links, and fonts for the `<head>` section.
  - **body**: Contains navigation, header, portfolio, about, contact, and footer sections of the body.
    - Each partial is categorized for clarity (e.g., `_v1-in_nav-in_body.php` for navigation).
- **sections**: The main content sections of the website, each with a specific layout.
- **assets**: Holds all CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts required by the template.

## Requirements

- PHP 7+ (to support `require` statements)
- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or local environment like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/freelancer-website-template.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd freelancer-website-template
   ```

3. **Set up the server:**
   - If using a local server, place the project folder in your server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
   - Start your server and navigate to `localhost/freelancer-website-template`.

4. **Access the Website:**
   Open the browser and go to `http://localhost/freelancer-website-template`.

## Code Explanation

- **`<!doctype html>` and `<html lang="en">`**: Standard HTML document structure.
- **PHP `require` statements**: Each major section (meta tags, CSS, fonts, header, footer) is imported from the `partials` folder, promoting code modularity.
- **`container`, `page-section`, and Bootstrap classes**: Used throughout for layout styling, while allowing Bootstrap components to manage design consistency.

## Customization

1. **Updating Content**:
   - Replace content in each partial inside the `partials` folder. For instance, to update the navigation, edit `partials/body/nav/_v1-in_nav-in_body.php`.
   
2. **CSS Customization**:
   - Add custom CSS in `partials/head/css/_css-in_head.php` or link to your CSS files.
   
3. **JavaScript**:
   - Include additional JavaScript files by adding them to `partials/body/js/_js-in_body.php`.

## Future Development

The current setup is ready for custom modifications. Potential enhancements:
- Implementing dynamic content (e.g., from a database).
- Adding additional sections or restructuring for other use cases.
